This is MacPGP.pm 1.2, a Perl interface to MacPGP 2.6.3.

REQUIREMENTS:
*MacPGP 2.6.3
*MacPerl 5.1.4r4
*Mac::Apps::Launch
*You might have to give MacPerl an extra meg of memory, I've had some
    problems with it quitting out on me.

This archive can always be obtained from:

    http://pudge.net/macperl/
    http://perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/CNANDOR/
    http://perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/Mac/

The file is a tarred, gzipped file.  Use Stuffit Expander or a
similar program to get at the archive.

You can use the file MacPGP.pm.asc to determine whether or not the 
file came from me.  First you have to have my key in your public 
keyring (it is in the file key.asc).  Then decrypt the file 
MacPGP.pm.asc with MacPGP. MacPGP will confirm that it is my singature 
to the file MacPGP.pm.

Please let me know how well it does(n't) work, and any changes you'd 
like to see.
