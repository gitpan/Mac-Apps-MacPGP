These scripts and extensions are examples of what can be done with
MacPGP.pm.  Programs that can be accessed through AppleEvents (e.g.,
YA-NewsWatcher) or an extension interface (e.g., BBEdit) can use
MacPGP.pm to encrypt/decrypt/sign.

The files are in a .sit.hqx archive.  Stuffit Expander or a similar
program must be used to retrieve the files from the archive.


NOTES:

    *The encrypt scripts/extensions will bring up a MacPGP dialog box
allowing you to choose recipients, one at a time.  Choose "OK" after
each recipient.  When you are done, click "Cancel" and the data will
be encrypted to all the recipients selected.

    *NewsWatcher differentiates between articles (non-editable posts,
usually by someone other than you) and messages (new, editable posts by
you).  So the Verify script will only work on articles and the Encrypt/
ClearSign scripts will only work on messages.

    *You could --and maybe should -- change some of the options in some
of the scripts to suit your needs.  For example, Droplets:Encrypt.pl
doesn't have the MacBinzarize option on, so most Mac files will not be
successfully encrypted.  But by setting $read='macb', the file will be
MacBinzarized first.

    *The BBEdit extensions require the BBEdit.pm module (and if you want
to edit them, the MacPerl BBEdit Extension), available at the MacPerl
FTP sites.  Also, I haven't been able to get these extensions to Undo
properly.  When I do, I'll update them.

    *I tried to write a script for Eudora Pro 3.0, but the AE handling
was really screwy ... rather than spend my time on it, I figure the
Clipboard scripts will suffice.

    *If you have OtherMenu, I highly recommend putting the script folder
in your OtherMenu folder.  With Glidel, you can also use Drag-n-Drop
with OtherMenu.
