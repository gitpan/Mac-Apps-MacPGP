This is MacPGP.pm 1.1, a Perl interface to MacPGP 2.6.3.

REQUIREMENTS:
*MacPGP 2.6.3 is REQUIRED!  See the pod documentation for more info.
*MacPerl 5.1.1 (just released in January 1997) is REQUIRED for fixed
    AppleEvents library.
*You might have to give MacPerl an extra meg of memory, I've had some
    problems with it quitting out on me.
*Mac::Apps::Launch is required

To install it, just drop the file MacPGP.pm in the directory
lib:Mac:Apps (this has changed from the beta 2).  Carefully look over
the pod documentation that is included in the MacPGP.pm file.  You can
view it with Shuck (which accompanies MacPerl 5.1.1) or with the pod2x
translators in the MacPerl pod directory.

There are a couple of behavioral changes and bug fixes from beta 2/3.
See the embedded pod for more information.

This archive can always be obtained from:

    http://pudge.net/macperl/
    http://perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/CNANDOR/
    http://perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/Mac/

The file is a tarred, gzipped file.  After you use Stuffit Expander or a
similar program to get at the archive, you can use the file
Macpgp.pm.asc to determine whether or not the file came from me.

First you have to have my key in your public keyring (it is in the file
key.asc).  Then decrypt the file Macpgp.pm.asc with MacPGP. MacPGP will
confirm that it is my singature to the file MacPGP.pm.

I think that is about it.  Let me know how things work out, and any
bugs, typos, suggestions, or anything else.
