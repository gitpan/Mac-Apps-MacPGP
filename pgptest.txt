Hey, I'm testing my MacPGP Perl script ... let me know if you can decrypt this ...

CLINTON:    ÒBe quiet!  I order you to be quiet!Ó
OLD WOMAN:  Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
CLINTON:    I am your president!
OLD WOMAN:  Well, I didn't vote for you.
CLINTON:    You don't vote for presidents.
OLD WOMAN:  Well, how did you become president, then?
CLINTON:    The Pollster of the Swamp, after calling a random sample of 
            the populace, held a piece of paper aloft from the bosom of 
            the Delaware signifying by Divine Providence ...  that I, 
            Clinton, was your favourite ... That is why I am your 
            president!
DENNIS:     Look,  strange men in ponds calling strangers and
            distributing leaves of papyrus is no basis for a system of 
            government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate 
            from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
CLINTON:    Be quiet!
DENNIS:     You can't expect to wield supreme executive power
            just 'cause some bespectacled outcast called a few people!
CLINTON:    Shut up!
DENNIS:     I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor just 
            because some shriveled fruit had called my friends, 
            they'd put me away!
CLINTON:    (Grabbing him by the collar) Shut up, will you. Shut up!
DENNIS:     Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
CLINTON:    Shut up!

PEOPLE (i.e. other PEASANTS) are appearing and watching.

DENNIS:     (calling) Come and see the violence inherent in the system.
            Help, help, I'm being repressed!
CLINTON:    (aware that people are now coming out and watching)
            Bloody peasant!
            (pushes DENNIS over into mud and prepares to ride off)
DENNIS:     Oh, what a give away.  Did you here that, did you here
            that, eh?  That's what I'm on about -- did you see him repressing
            me, you saw it didn't you?
CLINTON:    Come on, Hillary.
